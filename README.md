# Description 
Networks (or graphs) have become ubiquitous as data from diverse disciplines can naturally be mapped to graph structures. Social networks, such as academic collaboration networks and interaction networks over online social networking applications are used to represent and model the social ties among individuals. Information networks, including the hyperlink structure of the Web and blog networks, have become crucial mediums for information dissemination, offering an effective way to represent content and navigate through it. A plethora of technological networks, including the Internet, power grids, telephone networks and road networks are an important part of everyday life. The problem of extracting meaningful information from large scale graph data in an efficient and effective way has become crucial and challenging with several important applications and towards this end, graph mining and analysis methods constitute prominent tools. The goal of this course is to present recent and state-of-the-art methods and algorithms for analyzing, mining and learning large-scale graph data, as well as their practical applications in various domains (e.g., the web, social networks, recommender systems).
